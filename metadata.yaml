description: When Stephen strangled his housemaid, he enlisted the help of his friend
  to dispose of the body, and then pointed the finger at this same friend. A hateful
  bond is formed from a loyal friendship. As this story reaches its thrilling climax,
  it seems that the price must be paid for the screams that were silenced in the house
  by the river.
